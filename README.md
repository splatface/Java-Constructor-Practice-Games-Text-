Constructor Practice: Text Games

# Objective:
This is a group of folders containing text games written in Java for practicing constructors. Since constructors in Java can be confusing, these games were made as a way to practice how to write and call different attributes/parameters from classes and functions.

# Notes:
- athough these are called games, there may be some calculation errors as the main point of the program is for discovering the usages of constructors, not usability of all functions implemented
- most of the program should be error free, if not, please make sure all of the parameters are used in the same areas for best results

Thanks!
